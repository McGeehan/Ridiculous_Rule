			<h1>The Most Ridiculous Rule</h1>
				<p><b>I</b> once needed a <b>pen</b>. Figured this was a reasonable ask. Went to the supply closet on my floor, which was locked. <i>Asked</i> the floor's admin, she told me to go to the main supply room in the basement. Went to the basement and explained my situation of needing a pen. They told me all requests for supplies must be approved by my department head. </p>

		<h2> Awkward Introductions</h2>
				<p>	Problem is, being new, I'd never met my department head. She also worked in San Francisco (I worked in Philadelphia), so I needed to send an email both introducing myself, and asking her if I had permission to get a pen from the supply closet.</p>
